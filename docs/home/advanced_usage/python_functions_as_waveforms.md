In Bloqade we provide a set of commonly used waveform shapes for hardware applications, however, we also allow users to pass a large variety of python functions as Waveforms! There are two ways to go about using python functions as waveforms. The first involves the passing the function in to the `fn()` method when building your program. The second involves the `bloqade.waveform` decorator on your function which will turn it into a `Waveform` object.
