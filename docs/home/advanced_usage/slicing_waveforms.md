In some cases you may want to run a program but at intermediate time points as a parameter scan. To facilitate this we have added the `slice` method that can be called during the construction of the waveform. The `slice` method takes two arguments: `start` and `stop`. For the `start` argument determines the new starting point for the sliced waveform while `stop` specifies the new stopping time for the waveform. A valid slice must have `start <= stop`, `start >= 0`, and `stop <= duration`, where `duration` is the duration of the waveform.

`record` is another useful feature we have implemented to be used with `slice`. For example if you slice a waveform you may or may not know the value of the waveform at the value of `slice` but you need to be able create a waveform that is continuous, which requires knowledge of the value of the waveform at the end of the slice. A common use case for this is to take a rabi drive and make sure that is `0` at the end of the protocol in order make it compatible with hardware. A great example of this exact use case is [Quantum Scar Dynamics Tutorial](https://queracomputing.github.io/bloqade-python-examples/latest/examples/example-4-quantum-scar-dynamics/).
